# TransitVis
TransitVis is a work in progress project built to simulate and visualize transportation dynamics. The goal is to study, visualize, communicate, and explain the impacts different variables have on transportation.

Some example questions guiding the development of this project:
- How does grid size/network connectivity impact travel times for different modes (walk, bike, drive, transit)?
- How does vehicle size impact congestion?
- How does improved bus service impact mode choice and car traffic? (see Downs-Thompson Paradox)
- How does land use distribution impact transportation decisions?


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
