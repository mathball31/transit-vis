Travel demand model:
1. Trip Generation
    Home based Work
    Home based non-work
    non home based

Equation 1 - Attractions Equations (Based upon WFRC/MAG equations)
    HBW = 1.2167 * Total Employment
    HBO
    hbo = 0.8460 * Population + 2.8497 * Retail Employment
    hbsc = 0.4197 * Population
    hbsh = 1.6208 * Retail Employment + 0.7221 * Households
    hbpb = 0.6886 * Households + 0.9799 * Retail Employment + 0.1913 * Other Employment

    NHB = Â½ * (nhbwe + nhbne)
    nhbwe = 1.2130 * Total Employment + 0.7246 * Households
    (non-home, work)
    nhbne = 2.8188 * Households + 5.9869 * Retail Employment + 0.6750 * Other Employment
    (non-home, non-work)
Equation 2 - Production Equations
    HBW = 1.5660 * Households (fulltime)
    HBO = 6.4196 * Households (total)
    NHB = 3.3320 * Households (total)
