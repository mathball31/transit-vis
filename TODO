x render screen
x display map
x different distributions
x change distribution live

x integrate with angular or react
x update sliders to angular and make them work
x integrate slider into rendering
x factor canvas out of normal-distribution-controls
\ angularize the other distributions
    x refactor shared functionality. Abstract class?

x render multiple distributions

x sample from distribution
x move sample-button to app level
x sample from transitMap output distribution
. normalize and weight input distributions
x draw sample point
. split rendering into layers (i.e. don't clear samples when distribution changes)

x sample riders/locations
    x display
x route
    x display

x containerize apps
\ create road-network-proto
    x start with a basic grid
    \ expose some variables: e.g. block length, road width, connections per intersection
    . generate routes along grid
    . show e.g. 5 min walking radius as variables change

x automate compile and pack
. testing
. move controls to right side of page
. make controls a generic Directive
    or somehow make a wrapper that I can easily apply to any variable in the model


. bitmap style distribution

. model geography/transportation network
    . Pedestrian access distribution: 
      How likely will pedestrians use a tile?
      0 -> impassible/wall/fence
      1 -> Comfortable sidewalk
      (0,1) -> representing various levels of comfort and safety
        low values: more cars, smalle sidewalk, exposed to the elements
        high values: well lit, quieter, beautiful, safe
      tradeoff between time and access
    . render
      split range into values e.g. 0, < .2, < .4, < .6, < .8, < 1, 1
      and color accordingly

. GIS -> bitmap pipeline

. path finding for source/destination pair
    . ideal route
    . simulate single rider travel along route
    . simulate multiple riders/walkers
    . resolve conflicts/collisions in paths -> congestion

. other modes of transit?
    . change speed, acceleration
    . size of vehicle
    . mode change: walk to car, board bus/train, park bike
    . mode storage: parking
